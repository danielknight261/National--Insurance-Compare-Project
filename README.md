# Project Title

National Insurance Project

This is a simple project that allows you to input your national insurance contributions for the years 2018/19 and 2019/20, and it will display the difference. The MongoDB database uses a global IP address and does not require a .env file, so the project can be run by anyone by following the steps below.

The Stack:
The backend was created using Mongoose, MongoDB, Node, Express, and Cors, while the frontend was developed using React, Axios, and CSS.

## Deployment
